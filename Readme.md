Policy summary for Malaysia government:
As a policymaker focused on green economic development, it is essential to recognize the nuanced impacts of land use policies and environmental changes on ecosystem services as demonstrated by the analyses of carbon storage, water yield, crop pollination, sediment, and nitrogen export across SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. The findings suggest a gradual decline in carbon storage and an increase in sediment and nitrogen export, potentially indicating environmental degradation. Notably, the implementation of a no agricultural land change policy has resulted in mixed outcomes, showing slight improvements in pollination and nitrogen export but exacerbating the decline in carbon storage and increasing sediment export. These dynamics underscore the need for carefully crafted policies that consider regional differences and the interconnected nature of ecosystem services to foster sustainable development. Effective management strategies should aim to balance land use to support biodiversity, enhance water and soil quality, and maximize the benefits of ecosystem services, thereby contributing to a resilient green economy.
